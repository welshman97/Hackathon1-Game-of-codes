# Coding Federation

The Coding Federation is a website that aims to bring people wishing to become software developers together to learn to code in a self-paced but structured manner from industry professionals, and create a strong community-driven support network for learners. We aim to do this by providing comprehensive, self-paced coding education lead by industry professionals to help guide learners on their journey. We also build and provide community amongst our cohorts and give access to these community to our learners. We also bolster this with robust careers guidance from the start to help with CV writing, LinkedIn profiles, interview practices and live hackathons to simulate real working environments.

# Wireframing
In order to reflect our professional and well-structured ethos we decided to design a site that follows the same theme. In order to show this, we want a simple colour palette which on contains one accent colour. This accent colour will guide our user to the important features on each page. Ensuring an intuitive and simple user experience.

The navigation bar is available on all pages and allows access to all pages available on the website from any page within the site. This includes the home, courses, careers, and about pages. The logo links back to the homepage as is expected by most users. It makes navigating the entire website easy and intuitive for all users being fully responsive on all screensizes using mobile first design that makes sense to all types of users.
